# calculator

Hello everyone! This is going to be my last project of the TOP Foundations Course and today, I am building a basic implementation of a calculator! The calculator will feature a UI and be able to make basic calculations (hopefully more advanced features coming soon after!). After the project is finished, I should have been able to demonstrate a basic proficiency in the following skills: everything JS related up until the Etch-a-Sketch project, use of JS objects, and use of advanced array methods such as map, filter, and reduce. With that said, I hope everyone viewing this repo enjoys and thank you for stopping by!

Update: 
Just wanted to pop in here to say a couple of things! It's currently 10:13 PM on March 30, 2024, and I just finished this project. I wanted to apologize for the lack of use of advanced array methods (I know I only used like one!). In addition, I would like to give credit to the person whose project I was able to see and access via the TOP lesson associated with this project and the one I modeled mine after (not everything is the same, but a lot of the stylistic and functional features I tried to replicate). The link to their project is below.
